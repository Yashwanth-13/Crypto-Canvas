# Crytpo Canvas

*Powered by [Electron JS](https://www.electronjs.org/)*


Crypto Canvas integrates the features of a very basic image editor and also a very simple Steganography tool which aren't usually seen together in one application.

## Features
These things are very simple. So, we do have some ideas to improve the application
- Can change features of an image such as its brightness and contrast
- Can crop the image
- Can apply effects such as *Sepia* and also increase the *warmth* of the image.
- Can stack multiple images on top of each other
- Embed text into images and also retreive text from images

## Installation

After cloning the repository, run these commands in the root directory (of the repo) for the app to be up and running.

**NOTE:** *Node JS* needs to be installed prior to running these commands. Head to this [website](https://nodejs.org/en) for installation.

- *npm i*
- *npm start*

Any suggestions will be heard and valued!
